This project is a real-time webcam application using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe Holistic. When you run the code, your webcam feed appears in full screen and the program instantly detects and shows key points on your body, face, and both hands. Black pencil-thin lines connect the detected joints—like elbows, wrists, and shoulders—while each joint is marked with a small red dot. Labels appear next to each important part (such as “Nose,” “Right Wrist,” or “Left Thumb Tip”), and the labels smartly adjust their position so they never overlap, keeping the display clear.

The project can also measure your right arm’s elbow angle in real time, figure out when your right hand is open, and overlay “AR glasses” between your eyes. You can pause the video, take screenshots, or switch color themes using keys. Everything is calculated and drawn instantly, visually tracking your movements for educational demos, gesture experiments, or just for fun—all with no extra hardware required.
